In the [previous article](run-processes-in-background) we've talked about running and tracking processes in the background with the tools that Linux provides. Fortunately, there is a much easier and convenient way to do that using [hapless](https://pypi.org/project/hapless/) package. This is a Python project I've been recently working on and you can install it using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) like this

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade hapless
```
