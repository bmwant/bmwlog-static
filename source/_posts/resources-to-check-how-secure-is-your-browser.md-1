Even when openning anonymous tabs, cleaning cookies or using VPN you still share some important information that might open your identity. List of resources below shows how easily attacker may receive information that you think should be actually hidden.

**Detect your internal network IP address**

**Accurately get your location**

[https://browserleaks.com/geo](https://browserleaks.com/geo), you may also check a lot of different data that your browser exposes at [browserleaks.com](https://browserleaks.com).

**E-tag**

[ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) - might be used to uniquely identify you.

**Is your browser safe against tracking**

[https://panopticlick.eff.org](https://panopticlick.eff.org) check that here.

**Information about your browser and computer**

[https://whoer.net](https://whoer.net) a lot of data including IP, language, screen resolution etc might be found here.

**DNS exposes you IP**

[https://www.dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com) even if you are using VPN.

**Check your location with MAC of your router**
