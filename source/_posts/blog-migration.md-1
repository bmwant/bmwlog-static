Recently I've decided to migrate my blog written with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/)/Python 3 to be a SPA using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Due to a lack of free time I don't see this migration to be finished in the nearest future.

To continue publishing some notes online I went for [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) static site generator which allows quickly create new posts using simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax and deploy them either to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) (the latter one was chosen).

Below you can find a couple of screenshots for the previous version of the blog to have a taste of how it was looking back the good old days.
