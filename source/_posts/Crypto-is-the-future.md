*Disclaimer*: I do own crypto and I'm interested in the price appreciation for material gain, so if you think I'll be totally biased and subjective on the matter you should probably stop reading here.

### Intro

In this article I want to address some misconceptions about crypto currencies and highlight main points why I believe it will inevitably become a part of your life and eventually replace I don't think that Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is perfect, but it's still on early stage of developing and adopting, so most of the flaws will vanish in the nearest future. Therefore let me show you couple of the current cases against and provide arguments to support the world of crypto. Below you will find a list of statements and opposing facts which should provide context for better understanding of how thing actually work.


### It's just a waste of electricity

### Hardware shortage everywhere

### It has no real value

> The value is 100% imaginary. The system is based on a perceived value, and given people are in and out to make money off that perception: it‚Äôs basically a pyramid scheme.

You can apply the same to any asset on stock exachange or to any goods produced by the industry. Anything costs as much as people are willing to pay for it. That's just how market works. Price is simply a representation of a current demand.

Do not confuse [pyramids](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pyramidscheme.asp) / [Ponzi schemes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp) with cryptocurrencies. It's rather a [zero-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) game and every participant just finds his own strategy to play. You don't blame seller for making money off his store. Additionally, you shouldn't say chess is a blight just because of losing a game to a stronger player.

### Everyone involved is only doing this to make money

Continuations of the arguments above...

### It drastically affects global warming

### Future is bright

If you made it through the sections above you should be ready to check positive sides of using cryptocurrencies/blockchains as well.
First of all it's all about decentralization. No one controls or limits your ability to transfer money to another recepient. There is no third-party intermediary such as a bank which sets its own fees and proceeds each transaction. You are not limited to the amount or working hours as well as it cannot be cancelled by a regulator therefore restricting your intentions. ~~~

### Conclusion

With this article I wanted to educate people with a little knowledge on the crypto internals and show that downsides is only due to people trying to abuse the system. In every domain you will be able to find aspects which can be exploited and eventually a person who will try to take advantage of that. ~~~
Just remember that progress and true innovations always win in the end.
