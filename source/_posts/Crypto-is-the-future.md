*Disclaimer*: I do own crypto and I'm interested in the price appreciation for material gain, so if you think I'll be totally biased and subjective on the matter you should probably stop reading here.

### Intro

![money evolution](/images/photo_2021-04-30_12-51-27.png)

In this article I want to address some misconceptions about crypto currencies and highlight main points why I believe it will inevitably become a part of our lives and eventually replace existing financial institutions. I don't think that Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is perfect, but it's still on early stage of developing and adopting, so most of the flaws will vanish in the nearest future. Therefore let me show you couple of the current cases against and provide arguments to support the world of crypto. Below you will find a list of statements and opposing facts which should provide context for better understanding of how thing actually work.

### It's just a waste of electricity

First of all let's understand the [difference between](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/proof-of-stake) these two: [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) and [Proof of Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake). They are two main blockchain protocols, but the latter doesn't require a lot of computational power therefore it consumes less energy and has smaller impact on the environment.
Think of it as of v2 (next generation) consensus mechanism for the blockchain. Ethereum network (which is the [second largest](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) crypto by market capitalization) is [going to switch](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) to the PoS soon.

Any new technology at its early steps has a lot of drawbacks and that's an integral part of a developing lifecycle. Eventually less efficient methods and [shitcoins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp) without any utility will fade away driving evolution forward. What I'm trying to say here is that we are on the transition stage right now and a lot of [research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf) is being done to come up with better algorithms for distributed networks.

Although some studies [show](https://www.statista.com/statistics/881541/bitcoin-energy-consumption-transaction-comparison-visa/) that Bitcoin uses much more energy per transaction - in a big picture it doesn't look so horrible as most of the electricity [comes from renewables](https://coinshares.com/assets/resources/Research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019-fidelity-foreword.pdf) (see summary table below) and it still requires less power than current generation of banking system.

On the other side Bitcoin and other PoW currencies [incentivize evolution](http://squ.re/BCEI-whitepaper) of renewables and different approaches to obtain cheapest available electricity.

### Hardware shortage everywhere

Any precedent like this one drives forward a development of better protection It reminds me of an [Arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race) which isn't necessary a good thing, but it allows technologies to develop faster and eventually to be applied for peacful purposes.

### It has no real value

> The value is 100% imaginary. The system is based on a perceived value, and given people are in and out to make money off that perception: it‚Äôs basically a pyramid scheme.

You can apply the same to any asset on stock exachange or to any goods produced by the industry. Anything costs as much as people are willing to pay for it. That's just how market works. Price is simply a representation of a current demand.

Do not confuse [pyramids](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pyramidscheme.asp) / [Ponzi schemes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp) with cryptocurrencies. It's rather a [zero-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) game and every participant just finds his own strategy to play. You don't blame seller for making money off his store. Additionally, you shouldn't say chess is a blight just because of losing a game to a stronger player.

### Everyone involved is only doing this to make money

![where lamba](/images/photo_2021-04-30_13-21-27.jpg)

Nobody forces you to buy crypto as well as nobody forces you to [panic selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_selling) it giving profits to others. On the other hand every employee does his job to make money and that's totally normal. Why then? Furthermore, you don't criticize people for selling something they own to others and it doesn't matter whether it's something on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) / [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/) or crypto on the exchange.

Like in every domain where you do investments you should do your own research ([DYOR](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/do-your-own-research)) before throwing money into something. Most of the videos on youtube or articles on the web I've came across also emphasize on `not a financial advice` narrative, so the final decision is always up to you. When you see something involving high risks you have to understand that you invest only as much as you afford to lose.

Casinos and lottery?


### It drastically affects global warming

### Future is bright

If you made it through the sections above you should be ready to check positive sides of using cryptocurrencies/blockchains as well.
First of all it's all about decentralization. No one controls or limits your ability to transfer money to another recepient. There is no third-party intermediary such as a bank which sets its own fees and proceeds each transaction. You are not limited to the amount or working hours as well as it cannot be cancelled by a regulator therefore restricting your intentions. ~~~

* creating competitive solutions for existing projects with extra benefits (one example of it can be [digital advertising platform](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) allowing advertisers know their ads‚Äô effectiveness without violating privacy)

...and a lot more. Only [Cardano](https://cardano.org/enterprise/) blockchain by itself comes up with variety of solutions across multiple industry verticals. IOHK ~~money research~~ and works on fundamenatal cryptography problems such as [quantum resistance](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2018/02/01/research-program-to-work-on-hardening-cardano-against-quantum-computers/).


### Conclusion

With this article I wanted to educate people with a little knowledge on the crypto internals and show that downsides is only due to people trying to abuse the system. In every domain you will be able to find aspects which can be exploited and eventually a person who will try to take advantage of that. ~~~
Just remember that progress and true innovations always win in the end.
